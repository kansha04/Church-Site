     <p>A very warm welcome to <span style="font-weight: 500">Christ Centered Church, Leuven</span>. We are a Bible teaching Christian community, devoted to expressing the reality of Jesus Christ in our lives, through serving and worshiping our Lord, caring and praying for one another, and reaching out to the world through the power and love of the Holy Spirit. Our passion is to love, serve and worship God our Lord, and to love others the way He taught us.</p>
     <p>If you are looking for a place where you could not only experience an authentic community, but also be a part of a Christian family and the body of Christ, and if you are looking for an opportunity to learn about the extraordinary God, to build a personal relationship with Him as well as many lasting friendships with others like you, then you are most welcome to come and join us.</p>
